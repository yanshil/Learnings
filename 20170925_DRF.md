# Dominant Resource Fairness: Fair Allocation of Multiple Resource Types
## 09/25/2017

**Fair resource allocation**, different resource types, defferent demands.

Propose Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF), generalize *max-min fairness* (one of the most popular)

* Incentivized users to share resources
* Strategy-proof
* Pareto efficient

better thatn slot-based fair sharing schemes


### current allocation policy
Max-min fairness: maximize the minimum allocation received

equal share of the resource

weighted

provd performance isolation

support other policies including priority, reservation and deadline based allocation

so far on a single resource type

#### Ex of Hadoop and Dryad

allocate resources at the level of **fixed-size partitions of the nodes**, called *slots*

problem: despite the widely different demands for CPU, memory and I/P resources.

## DRF

In a multi-resource envionment

determined by user's dominant share.

> In a nutshell, DRF seeks to maximize the minimum dominant share across all users.

> Four such properties are sharing incentive, strategy-proofness, Pareto efficiency, and envy-freeness.

guarantee no user is better off in a system

...

envy-free

> DRF provides incentives for users to share resources by guaranteeing that no user is better off
in a system in which resources are statically and equally partitioned among users. Furthermore, DRF is strategyproof,
as a user cannot get a better allocation by lying about her resource demands. DRF is Pareto-efficient as
it allocates all available resources subject to satisfying the other properties, and without preempting existing allocations.
Finally, DRF is envy-free, as no user prefers the allocation of another user.
