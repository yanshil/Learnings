# SLAQ: Quality-Driven Scheduling for Distributed Machine Learning

## Keywords

Scheduling, Machine Learning, Approximate Computing, Resource Management, Quality

## Keypoint

SLAQ, a cluster scheduling system for approximate ML training jobs that aims to maximize the overall job quality

## 

* ML algorithms are intrinsically approximate
* ML training is typically iterative with diminishing returns.
* Training ML is an exploratory process.

> SLAQ leverages the fact that most ML training algorithms
are implemented as an iterative optimization process.
By continually monitoring the history of quality
improvement and runtime, SLAQ generates highlytailored
and accurate quality predictions for future training
iterations.

### Challenges

* ML training algorithms measure the quality of
models with tens of different metrics, which makes it dif-
ficult to compare the training progress of different jobs
* SLAQ should be able to precisely predict the
impact that an extra unit of resources would have on
the quality and runtime of ML training jobs
* While SLAQ works with a large
class of important ML algorithms, some non-convex ML
algorithms are not currently supported.
