### Heterogeneity and Network Structure in the Dynamics of Diffustion: Comparing Agent-Based and Differential Equation Models

* Question/Problem: When use AB and when use DE
* DE:
	* + have wide range of feedbackeffects
	* - typically aggregate agents into small number of states (compartment)
	* Within each compartment, people are assumed to be homogeneous
* AB
	* + Can include Heterogeneity in individual attributes
	* - Cost, high complexity 
	* - Cognitive burden (Explainatory?)
	* - Limit time and resource
